# TabZap

Zap your duplicate tabs in Safari™!

I was about to start on a new project and had pulled a bunch of tabs to start (in everyone's favorite browser, Safari™), but then realized I had opened up a few duplicate tabs. Frantically I searched the App™ Store™ for a Safari™ extension™--unfortunately they were all paid. Not wanting to be down a dollar I decided make my own Safari™ extension™.
Notes:
 - Should allow this on all website (in Safari™ ~~Preferences™~~ Settings™)
 - Can download it in "releases"
 - You get what you pay for: I'm a literal cheapskate
 - Literally cooked up in less than 10 minutes with no experience with the Safari™ App™ extension™ APIs
 - Is a Safari™ App™ extension™ (as opposed to a Safari™ Web™ extension™)
 - Should probably not be used as an example for how to efficiently do recursion and find duplicates
